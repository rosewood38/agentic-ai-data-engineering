# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

# The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
# Best Approach (Optimal) – Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = None
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += 1 if num == candidate else -1
        
        return candidate
